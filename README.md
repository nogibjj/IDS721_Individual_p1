# IDS_Individual_p1
A good starting point for a new Rust project

## Usage
This cli tool takes one arguement which is the name. You can use command line cargo run -- Date -- name <Your name>. It can identify the name, and if it is my name "Yuxin" it can print out the current system time for me or print a question for strangers.


## Implementation
This follows the template from professor Noah Gift. And make some modifications based on the marco-polo games from the rust-template-MLOPs. The main.rs contains the major function of this tool, and the lib.rs contains one function for mapping the massges to result string.
